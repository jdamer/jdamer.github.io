In our first article, we introduced the healthcare consumer journey and explored the Research phase. Today, we move the token one space to the right, into the Booking phase to address the challenges of access.

Access is complicated. It involves two core elements which each have their own challenges: booking process and availability. To the consumer, only the booking process feels visible, but that process is largely controlled by availability issues that occur on the provider side of the equation. Ultimately, both should be invisible to the consumer. They shouldn’t notice that any hurdles exist. 

Getting to the level of seamless booking that consumers have come to expect in other areas of life may not be around the corner, but we can start to reduce these challenges by first understanding what the real issues are and then working toward new, tech-driven solutions. 

## Why is Booking an Appointment Such a Difficult Task?

Too often practices remain stuck in antiquated booking processes. A patient that wants to make a simple appointment calls in, gets put on hold, then gets prompted to leave a message for someone who will return their call. Easy enough, except is doesn’t end there. When the scheduler calls back, the patient will often miss the call, sending them back into the cycle ad nauseum until they give up and try again the following year. That may be extreme, but in this workflow it’s clear that the patient’s needs come second to the convenience of the scheduler. The patient is expected to put their life on hold, just to schedule an appointment. And this is supposed to be okay.

### How do You Solve that Problem? 

This is a major process challenge, but it’s an easier one to solve than those that move into the world of availability. 

The first place we can look is obvious: online scheduling. However, it’s not as simple as it seems. While some practices have begun to adopt online appointment scheduling, this is typically available only to current patients that have signed up for the provider’s EHR. Even then it is unlikely that the full transaction can be completed online. It is more likely than the alleged online appointment scheduling tools is an “appointment request” tool, which requires the patient to wait while a proper time is selected for them and confirmed. This is a step in the right direction, but adds little more convenience than the traditional call in / call back model. 

Making an appointment with a doctor is not the same as booking a table at a restaurant. Appointments vary in length, complexity, and dependencies. You may not be able to schedule a single doctor if the care you need is cross-functional. There are also certain times of day that are required if you need certain types of appointments. And the availability of a doctor can shift without warning. Moving patient scheduling to the web is very complicated, though not impossible. 

Before getting to web-based scheduling, there are other ways to start to streamline access. To start, instead of routing everyone to a unique scheduler for each doctor, you can move toward a call center or centralized scheduling model. To really make a difference, you first must take away the idea of the individual. A single person that is responsible for scheduling a doctor’s time will always produce a doctor-centric, patient-inconvenient system.

When you shift to a centralized model, you not only add convenience for your customers, you also start to provide a consistent experience. When you provide a consistent experience, you can start to measure the effectiveness of different methods, experiment with new methods, and share best practices across your suddenly more connected system. Moving in a new direction allows you to shift from a process rooted in routine, to an optimized process that focuses on error-reduction, patient satisfaction, and efficiency. 

On the digital side of things, instead of requiring someone to talk on the phone, you can implement chat on your website for booking and simple questions. Chat is relatively simple to implement and provides a convenient alternative for people that either do not want to talk on the phone or cannot talk on the phone. It also prevents errors of transcription, as the person taking the information from the patient can see everything clearly spelled out and does not have to try to guess what was said.

In addition, for practices that do offer online appointment booking, one of the ideas that healthcare can borrow from the world of ecommerce is to not make accounts a requirement. When companies require that a user create an account before they can make a purchase online, they see lower adoption. By not requiring an account, purchases are made easier and therefore happen more frequently. In healthcare, by allowing prospective patients to request appointments (or better, schedule them) without first signing up for an EHR, the prospective patient has a better initial experience with the practice. Additionally, by making this first digital connection, you may just get them to sign up for the EHR or fill out forms online, both of which help create better, more reliable patient data and more efficient service.

The key in all of these ideas is that access needs to shift from provider’s convenience (in time of day and channel) to patient’s convenience. Once you shift to that mindset, the opportunities and benefits reveal themselves. 

Remember, this is the first interaction that a potential customer has with your healthcare organization. It should be exceptional. It should set the tone for how easy working with your organization will be for all interactions that follow. 

But, booking is only part of the challenge of access. The real hurdles, are all about availability. 

## Beyond booking. The availability challenge.

Easier booking is only half the battle when it comes to access. If it is easy to make an appointment, but you cannot make an appointment for three months, then the value is significantly reduced. This is the real heart of the challenge when it comes to access. Doctors are not available anytime, anywhere. In fact, for some specialties, shortages of doctors are projected in the near future, due to either increased incidence of conditions, decrease in doctor supply, or both. If you want to make the problem worse, live in a remote area where access to doctors, particularly specialists, is severely limited.

In theory, a team of data-sharing doctors with a consistent set of practice standards could take on a more fluid staffing model. By sharing data — and having really, really good data — and methodologies, the particular doctor becomes less important. This means that the specialist you see for your first appointment and the one you see for a follow-up or procedure is the first one that is available, and you do not have any reason to care. 

That problem is tougher to solve, but there are problems we can tackle in an easier space. Access is not just a problem for complex work, it is also a problem for routine care.

### Your friendly neighborhood retailer to the rescue!

There is a growing trend amongst retailers that helps with this issue: retail clinics that take on many primary care functions. Started by pharmacies like CVS and more recently gaining traction from Wal-Mart’s onslaught of clinic openings in rural areas, the retail clinic is an answer to part of the problem of access. But it is only a piece of the puzzle. 

As retail clinics grow, doctors in traditional settings will be able to focus on the complicated, challenging stuff. The easy stuff, the low hanging fruit, just gets in the way. It fills primary care doctor’s schedules and makes getting in for appointment harder for the truly sick. There are things that can easily be taken care of at a clinic run by a hospital that just happens to be in a Wal-Mart or a CVS. Things you can walk in for. Doctors should rejoice. Patients have access and doctors can focus a little more on each patient and the really challenging work. 

But this is also a threat to doctors. Many doctors are incentivized not for the complexity of work, but for things like throughput. Though concepts like value-based care aim to change that, for some these retail clinics are seen as a real threat. 

On the flip-side, some traditional physician offices will learn from their new competitor set and adopt some elements of the retail experience as their own. This can only benefit patients, as retail is perhaps the best example for creating an always-on, customer-centric brand. 

Many of these changes are focused on changes in primary care physician access, with some pundits going as far as saying that we are nearing the end of the primary care doctor. The end of the primary care doctor may be far from reality today, but the end of the traditional primary care doctor model is just around the corner. 

### Breaking geographic barriers

A rural Wal-Mart offering basic services is a great start for both patients and doctors. But, it’s not everything. You won’t find your oncologist in a Wal-Mart and realistically you wouldn’t want to. No, there are some things that must take place in a hospital or other inpatient facility. If you live in a rural area, the mega-hospital, or the surgery center will not come to you. That is not going to change anytime too soon (though mobile surgery centers would be kind of cool), but we can change how we connect with patients before and after the required travel (if there ever is any). We can use technology. 

The emergence of telehealth (the practice of medicine, including diagnosis over video chat, email, or other means) is a major boon to patient experience, but it has not fully realized its potential. One of the common objections to telehealth is that it does not reach the right patients. The logic to the objection is that telehealth services are for smartphone carrying, wealthy, urbanite millennials, who just happen to be the consumers that often use the least healthcare services. Essentially, the investment is wasted because the users do not exist. 

We will cover the real obstacles to adoption in an upcoming post, but the lack of a potential audience is false logic. There have been some positive examples that span demographics. Lower income patients have been some of the highest-rate adopters of text messaging services, such as text4baby, and adoption of smartphones in the US is rising for all consumers — elderly, rural, and low income included — not just wealthy, young urbanites. Further, in a related context, the elderly are actually using portals and other provider-based technologies as frequently or more frequently than younger audiences.

What’s more, consumers are clamoring for services that make connecting with their doctors more convenient. In surveys 93% of respondents say that they prefer doctors who connect with them via email. We are at the beginning of this change, but good progress has already been made. In addition to text services and emails, we have started to see doctors consulting 24 hours a day via video chat at places like the Cleveland Clinic and even streaming their procedures online. 

Video chat can become the new triage. Instead of picking up the phone and talking to a nurse, a video chat lets a practitioner quickly establish whether or not a potential patient should come in, thus saving everyone time and money and ensuring that those that truly need care are seen. 

## What does it all mean?

These are pieces of the puzzle. Healthcare access does not get better by standing still and using the existing processes. We are starting to see the beginnings of a sea change, where patients are empowered to choose when and how they connect with their doctors, how they make appointments, and whether or not they use a traditional care facility. The traditional model is eroding. Healthcare providers can either go down with the ship or embrace new strategies and technologies that put the patient first. 

When you combine web based appointment booking, a call-center model for appointments, fluid staffing models, retail clinics, and telehealth you start to get an idea of how the rules of access are changing, and what a truly patient-first practice looks like.
